### Prerequisites: 
- 1920x1080 monitor (or you can get custom cordinates for buttons)
- sqaure canvas
- magic marker
- 150x150 image
- the less colours less likely it is to break
- python
- pyautogui
- pillow
- have to be using the new controls (right click to open magic marker menu)

### How to Run:
1. Install Python 3
2. install pyautogui and pillow using the following command
```bash
    pip install pyatuogui pillow
```
3. open rec room and create a sqaure canvas
4. put an image in place of the default one (that is 150x150) (might be a good idea to posterize the image in order for it to use less colours and take less time to print and be more reliable)
5. grab the marker, and focus on the canvas
. to run the program either double click the "main.py" or run "python main.py" within the directory that contains it
